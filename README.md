## Description

This rock, paper, scissors program done in JavaScript lets a user play the popular game with a computer player. The game goes for 5 rounds, and if it's a draw on the 5th round, the game continues until a winner is decided. The player can reset the game and scores at any point.

## Technical Details

* Vanilla Javascript and plain HTML and CSS are used to create this program. No frameworks or libraries.
* CSS is used to animate the choices and reset buttons upon hovering and clicking.
* After a winner is determined, the choices are disabled until the player resets the game.
* A message appears to announce the winner.

## Pending Tasks

* Modify code to ES6
* DRY
